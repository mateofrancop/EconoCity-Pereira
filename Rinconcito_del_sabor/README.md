In the dashbord done in power bi, you can see how there is a dowland trend of sales on the line graph, besides finding out about the company i found that there is a denpendence from a near university, therefore in month like November-December and june - july which studends get out of class (holidays) the sales decrease, also since there was a closure in the scheduled appointment in the mornig and they made it virtual the decrease sales started off.

- ##### Input features 	

How you can see in the histogram graph the mostly input data is between 400.000 and 500000 this mean that there are more days with sales in this range. what is a little worried having in account that the company need improve his sales

- ##### Output features
 
1. Since april 2022 to june 2023 the whole output was 130,7 mill. which last year had an increment owing to the economic and political enviroment.

2. the three main expensives are: supplies, payroll and rent, what is normal in this field. 

3. In other hand there are other three expensives that could be related with suplies which are: beverage cost, disposable expenses, meccato expenses. being beverege cost with more outputs .

4. And last but not least there are a scatter plot in which two variables are related in this case inputs and outputs, and how you can se the graph is diagonal, this indicates that the relationship is directly proportional, in other words, this indicates that between more money you invest more sales you will do
